    <h1>Pizza</h1>
    <img src="../images/pizza.jpg" alt="A photo of a pizza">
    <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300g strong bread flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>100ml passata</li>
        <li>fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>125g mozzarella</li>
        <li>handful of parmesan</li>
        <li>handful of cherry tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt.</li>
        <li>Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough.</li>
        <li>Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth.</li>
        <li>Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it is not essential for a thin crust.</li>
        <li>Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste.</li>
        <li>Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
        <li>On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin.</li>
        <li>The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven.</li>
        <li>Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li>
        <li>heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8.</li>
        <li>Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon.</li>
        <li>Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season.</li>
        <li>Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. </li>
        <li>Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp.</li>
        <li>Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using.</li>
    </ol>
